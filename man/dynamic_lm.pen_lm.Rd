\title{Fit a penalized coxph or CSC supermodel for a specific coefficient}
\usage{
\method{dynamic_lm}{pen_lm}(object, lambda, x = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted object of class "pen_lm". This can be created by
calling \code{\link[=pen_lm]{pen_lm()}} using arguments \code{lmdata} and \code{xcols}.}

\item{lambda}{Value of the penalty parameter \code{lambda} at which to fit a
model. For cause-specific Cox super models, this must be a list or vector
of values: one for each cause.}

\item{x}{Logical value. If set to true, \code{lmdata} is stored in the returned
object. This is required for internal validation.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link[survival:coxph]{survival::coxph()}} or
\code{\link[riskRegression:CSC]{riskRegression::CSC()}}}
}
\value{
An object of class "penLMcoxph" or "penLMCSC" with components:
\itemize{
\item model: fitted model
\item type: as input
\item w, func_covars, func_lms, lm_covs, all_covs, outcome: as in lmdata.
\item LHS: the survival outcome
\item linear.predictors: the vector of linear predictors, one per subject. Note
that this vector has not been centered.
\item lambda: the values of lambda for which this model has been fit.
\item LHS: the survival outcome
\item args: arguments used to call model fitting
\item pen_args: arguments used to call the penalized model
\item id_col: the cluster argument, often specifies the column with patient ID
\item lm_col: column name that indicates the landmark time point for a row.
}
}
\description{
Use one value of \code{lambda} to fit a model from which predictions can be made.
}
\details{
The Breslow method is used for handling ties, as we use the \code{glmnet}
package which does the same.
