\title{Print the output from calling \code{pen_lm()}}
\usage{
\method{print}{pen_lm}(x, all_causes = FALSE, silent = FALSE, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a pen_lm object}

\item{all_causes}{if \code{pen_lm()} fit a cause-specific Cox model, set TRUE to
print a summary of the glmnet path for each model.}

\item{silent}{Set TRUE to hide messages.}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits to include}

\item{\dots}{additional print arguments}
}
\description{
Similar to the output of printing a\code{glmnet} object, print a summary of the
glmnet path at each step along the path.
}
\details{
If the model is a survival model (i.e., no competing risks), then the output
is the same as a call to glmnet would produce. For competing risks, the
default is only to print the output for the cause of interest (first cause).
Further events can be examined by setting \code{all_causes = TRUE}.

As in glmnet,
"A three-column matrix with columns \code{Df}, \verb{\%Dev} and \code{Lambda} is printed.
The \code{Df} column is the number of nonzero coefficients (Df is a
reasonable name only for lasso fits). \verb{\%Dev} is the percent deviance
explained (relative to the null deviance)."
